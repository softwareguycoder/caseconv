NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR COUNTRY.  AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.

HOW DO YOU DO TODAY, MA'AM?  I AM WELL, THANK YOU.

AND ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT, I THINK I WILL GO EAT A CHEESEBURGER FOR LUNCH TODAY.
